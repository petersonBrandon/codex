# Codex

## Description
Codex is a project based social platform. Where creators will set up a project
and can make social media posts, blog posts, and create forums, specific to
that project.

Codex is a new platform for anyone and everyone.

## Getting Started (User)

This platform is still in early development and is not ready for public use as
yet. Keep an eye on it as it progresses though so that you can be one of the
first to use it!

## Getting Started (Contributor)

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Any edits made to the project while the development server is up will auto refresh
the server.
